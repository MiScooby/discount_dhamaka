                            <p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Company.

You therefore agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion.</p>
                            <p>When any information is uploaded to Your User account, it sends it over the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This method encrypts the information to help prevent others from reading it while it’s in transit from your computer to Us. If you’re using the Website to upload sensitive data, you should properly secure your computer. To help do this, you can use anti-spyware and virus protection software. You can also restrict access to your computer and/or mobile device (for example, by using a strong password for your  login and a network firewall).</p>
                            <P>The Company shall not be held liable in any way for events beyond our control or in any way for accidental or unauthorised access of your information. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.</P>
